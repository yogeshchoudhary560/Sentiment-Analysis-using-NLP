# Sentiment-Analysis-using-NLP
The main objective of this project is to perform Sentiment Analysis on textual data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This project demonstrates how text data such as customer reviews or social media posts can be analyzed to determine whether the sentiment expressed is positive or negative,
📚 About the Dataset

Dataset Name: Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset

Source: Public dataset available on GitHub

Description: The dataset consists of thousands of tweets, each labeled as positive (1) or negative (0). Example columns:

Review_Text — text content of the tweet

Sentiment — 1 for Positive, 0 for Negative

This dataset is ideal for training NLP models to predict emotions or sentiments based on text.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

Platform: Google Colab

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Techniques Used:

Text Preprocessing (Cleaning, Stopword Removal)

TF-IDF Vectorization

Logistic Regression Classification

Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report

🧩 Process Overview

Data Loading: Imported a public sentiment dataset from GitHub.

Data Cleaning: Removed noise, stopwords, and unnecessary symbols from text.

Feature Extraction: Converted text to numerical features using TF-IDF.

Model Building: Trained a Logistic Regression model to predict sentiment.

Evaluation: Evaluated the model using accuracy and confusion matrix visualization.

Prediction: Tested the model on new sample sentences (e.g., “I love Coca-Cola products!” → Positive).

💡 Key Insights

The trained model can accurately classify tweets as positive or negative with high precision.

The project highlights the potential of NLP in real-world business analytics, such as analyzing brand reputation, customer reviews, and social media feedback.

Tools like Python and Scikit-learn make it easier to process large volumes of text efficiently.

🏁 Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of Sentiment Analysis using NLP. It provides valuable insight into how companies like Coca-Cola can monitor customer opinions and improve their brand strategy using data analytics. Through this task, a practical understanding of machine learning, text processing, and predictive analytics was achieved under the Data Analytics Domain of Codetech IT Solutions.
